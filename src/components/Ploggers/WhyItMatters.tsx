               Plogging isn't about perfection — it's about participation. When people 
               come together to care for their surroundings, something powerful happens: 
               communities become more connected, spaces become more valued, and change 
               becomes visible.
             </p>

               In Chh. Sambhajinagar, we believe that small actions, done consistently 
               and collectively, create the kind of change that lasts.
